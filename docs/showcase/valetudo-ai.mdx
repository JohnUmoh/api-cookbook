# Valetudo AI

**Valetudo AI** is a science-backed medical assistant powered by the Perplexity Sonar API. It provides fast, clear, and well-cited answers to health questions — helping users cut through misinformation with filters, image analysis, and ready-made prompt templates.

Designed for conscious users — like parents, patients, and medical students — seeking reliable information.

## Features

- **Cited Answers** — sourced from a curated list of 10 trusted medical domains
- **Smart Filters** — by date and country for localized, up-to-date insights
- **Image Upload** — analyze photos of medication, conditions, or packaging
- **Prompt Templates** — 7 categories for symptom checks, drug safety, research, and more
- **Simple UI** — built with React and Tailwind CSS

## How It Uses the Sonar API

Valetudo AI integrates with [Perplexity Sonar Pro](https://docs.perplexity.ai), leveraging advanced features for domain-specific search and rich responses:

| Trusted Domains       | `search_domain_filter`             | Restricts results to vetted health sources         |
| Visual Input          | `image_url`                        | Enables image-based medical queries                |
| Freshness Filter      | `search_after/before_date_filter`  | Helps surface recent and relevant findings         |
